<!-- Example entry format:
- **Response style:** Concise — lead with the answer, skip preamble
- **Code style:** No trailing summaries after edits; the diff speaks for itself
- **Commits:** Always bundle related changes into one PR rather than splitting
- **Error handling:** Only validate at system boundaries; don't add defensive checks inside internal code
- **Testing:** Integration tests must hit a real database — no mocks
